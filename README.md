# Personal Hub

A static website to publish articles, posts, with hand-made templating, file change watchers/compilers, and a super tag system: that was fun \o/

Hosted as a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) and accessible at [maxlath.eu](http://maxlath.eu).

Hardly usable by anyone else I'm afraid: little to no documentation, built artifacts everywhere as they are required for the Github page to work. But maybe you can take some ideas, who knows :)
