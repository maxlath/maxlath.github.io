# Personal Hub

A static website to publish (long) articles, (short) posts, slides, and more with one-time rendering through an (ugly) hand-made templating system, file change watchers/compilers, and a super tag system: that was fun :D

Hosted as a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) and accessible at [maxlath.eu](http://maxlath.eu).

Hardly usable by anyone else I'm afraid: little to no documentation, built artifacts and redirection files are lying around everywhere as they are required for the Github page to work. But maybe you can take some ideas, who knows :)


TODO:
* add post-css compilation for cross browser compatibility
* actually write Time-Capsule project page
