Hi, you have reached my web hub, a place where I link to stuffs I do or write.

Some context.

I'm a few-decades-old human contributing to the transition toward a post-consumerist, caring, sustainable society. It took a while, but I'm now considering this to be difficultly compatible with a capitalist organization of society. I don't have that many solid certitudes on what should come to replace it, but that got to involve a good share of solidarity and [commons](/tags/commons), while maximizing individuals freedom, and minimizing administrative burden. [easy](/assets/img/pas_de_probleme.mp4).

Among the macro and micro resistances against capitalist totalitaristic trends, I have a particular focus on the [systemic toxicity of commercial propaganda](/articles/paper-ethical-marketing/) and [what could come to replace it](/articles/p2p-rm).

Experimenting on that question of how to reorganize information on resources brought me to where I am now: using most of my time developing [inventaire.io](https://inventaire.io), a web app that lets you do the inventory of your books to inform your network of which book you can give, share, or sell, while contributing to the web of [linked open data](/tags/linkedopendata) on resources. [Citizens empowerment](/posts/accelerate-the-ecological-transition-economic-darwinism/) is the mission, [libre software](/tags/libre) and [open knowledge](/tags/openknowledge) is the way!

I'm also contributing to different strategies of resistance against industrialized attention capture for commercial purposes (a.k.a. advertisment), one being the ridiculously inefficient but symbolically interesting [human ad blocker](/posts/ad-blocker-humain/) strategy.
