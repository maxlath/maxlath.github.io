<h3 id="3-1">3.1<span class="titletab"></span> Toward an ecology of the spirit?</h3>
<h4 id="3-1-1">3.1.1<span class="titletab"></span> Downfall of the esprit value and systemic toxicity</h4>
<p>There
  is no subsistence imperative in consuming that much or this way, rather a
  metastabilized social construction, a culture, organizing overconsumption
  and waste, in which marketing developed transductive relations that is
  forces that contribute to shape the milieu, while the milieu that was the
  growingly consumerist society shaped marketing. Marketing as we know it is
  thus the science of motivation in a consumerist society, taking in account
  its values and cultural evolutions while influencing them. The
  self-sustaining loop between marketing and consumerism progressively
  metastabilized a culture in which the systematic attempt of marketing to
  play with limits of what is or isn’t acceptable, found a fertile ground in
  the growing nihilism. This downfall of the “<em>esprit</em>value” was
  already observed by Paul Valéry in his 1931 book&nbsp;<em>Regards
    sur le monde actuel&nbsp;</em>[An
  eye on today’s world] (Valéry 1931, p.178). Another path in the value
  milieu i.e. the spiritual thinking milieu might have produced a different
  form of marketing while the evolution of this milieu will necessarily
  produce a different marketing, encountering and thus composing with
  different forces. Trying to shape an ethic of marketing is thus not only
  to reaffirm limits in the field of possibilities but also to influence
  marketing inner dynamics which, as a collective individual, is also
  becoming under the forces of its milieu. A clear illustration of this
  transductive relation is the evolution of the relation between marketing
  and ecologic values, which didn’t only resulted in an opposition of forces
  between two supposedly antagonist collective individuals but also and
  growingly in an attempt from marketing to adopt non-consumerist values and
  to create relationships in this newly stabilized milieu: there is no
  necessary dogma to marketing, rather a logic of efficiency adapting the
  relationship’s symbolic content to the targeted market with milieu’s
  constraints. This evolution of marketing adopted the sustainable
  development approach, which is a composition of the two antagonist value
  system that are consumerism and ecology, trying to conciliate infinite
  growth and responsibility toward social and environmental concerns.
  Despite the hopes the sustainable development created, its deceptive
  effects were acted in the last Rio summit as highly insufficient. This
  composition also produced greenwashing and, by extension, socialwashing,
  which seems to be applications of the “<em>How might these factors&nbsp;</em>[growing environment and social concerns]&nbsp;<em>affect
    what I am doing (i.e. profitability)?</em>” ethical paradigm (Brennan
  1991, p.4) in the new balance of power among values and concerns.
  Nevertheless, there are real evolution of business paradigms with the
  renewed interest for social entrepreneurship and green entrepreneurship,
  able to implement systems of responsible production such as
  cradle-to-cradle approach or new forms of management exploring new
  work/life-time balance.</p>

<p>But
  how could marketing deal with the direct critique of its own toxicity,
  which, as said in the first part, is much more abstract, distant and hard
  to measure? Marketing is toxic as it socialized in a milieu encouraging
  immoderation and irresponsibility, just as a child who never met the sane
  authority of an system of care and thus didn’t correctly produced its
  Super-Ego, its inner limits. Could marketing be said responsible of those
  psycho-social disturbances? Not more than the nail is responsible of the
  hole it is in: marketing practices stuck to the social and legal limits it
  encounter, its excesses result in the absence or the weakness of opposite
  forces while being the production of a much larger hammer that are the
  materialist, consumerist and nihilist trends in a system encountering
  difficulties to regulate irresponsibility that is the balance of power
  between globalized corporations and national justice apparatuses. The
  practice of this&nbsp;<em>pharmakon</em>>&nbsp;thus results in a
  quasi-systematic attempt to file the void of opposite forces: if it was
  legal and socially acceptable – i.e. if there was not opposite forces – to
  distribute free packets of cigarettes in front of schools, not doing it
  would be a lost opportunity in a competitive market and thus, in a
  practice of marketing blinded of his responsibility larger than profit, a
  fault from the manager who doesn’t seize this opportunity. The historical
  trend of growingly responsible consumers illustrate this point (Irving et
  al. 2002).</p>

<h4 id="3-1-2">3.1.2<span class="titletab"></span> The
  problem of added value evaluation</h4>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>In
    the hyperindustrial political economy, value must be completely
    calculable; which is to say, it is condemned to become valueless—such is
    its nihilism<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Stiegler
    2006b)</p>

<p>The
  question of value and how to measure it is at the heart of the
  consumerism’s critiques: the cult of money as the only indicator of value,
  illustrated through the permanent reference to GDP growth and finding its
  last avatar in the Green Economy paradigm – supposed to reinforce the
  sustainable development paradigm and aiming the value calculation of every
  natural resource in order to ease the calculation of risks and impacts of
  an activity (Runnalls 2011) – that lead to a dead-end regarding
  psychological well-being and transindividuation, for which there is no
  reliable measure available, out of side-effects statistics such as the
  rate of suicides that are only indicative due to multiple co-determinants
  and cultural bias between nations, but still gives the opportunity to
  observe changes in time. This uncalculable aspect of the problem
  highlights the difficulty one’s would meet while trying to integrate such
  a psychological side-effect of the economic activity into an updated
  “triple-bottom-line”-like concept: before trying to reform their
  practices, marketers would have to rethink value creation in order to
  identify the more contrasted impact of marketing. From a strictly
  mono-value approach, i.e. classic accountancy, marketing is clearly a
  value creation accelerator; this fact can only be contested if we enlarge
  the definition of value. Attempts to rethink value (Lordon 2009; Lardeux
  &amp; Beth 2011) echoes strongly with the philosophic zoom-out of the
  Heideggerian analysis of the technique that is calculation as an
  artificial attempt to seize the real and its certitude, to have control on
  it, which is in the end an attempt to desperately flight from the only
  certitude of life that is death (Barison &amp; Ross 2004). If we never
  incorporate other value such as aesthetic or meaningfulness – i.e. the>&nbsp;<em>esprit</em>&nbsp;value
  – or even a kind of conglomerated indicator of the happiness or the desire
  created in our bottom lines, it is because we have no mean to catch it, it
  flight from calculation. And still, it is blindness not to think those
  values in the process of value creation. We are here at the heart – and
  won’t go further up the ladder – of the abstraction the daily busy
  marketer can’t take in account but that we have to think to build anything
  meaningful regarding the production of ethical marketing recommendations.</p>

<h3 id="3-2"> 3.2<span class="titletab"></span> What are the alternatives?</h3>

<p>Describing
  marketing as a limitless, blind or monstrous discipline is of absolutely
  no use in our project of thinking an ethic of marketing: the development
  of marketing is sensible to its environment and is hence already
  self-limiting itself according to the previously mentioned legal and
  social framework. A current illustration of it is the shy development of
  neuromarketing for which “marketing researchers have long feared the
  public outcry against potential ethical and privacy issues” (Morin 2011,
  p.132): the problem is then that once one tried to put the finger on it
  and didn’t get burned, there was no contradictory incentive not to follow
  the movement.</p>

<p>The
  political project regarding marketing would be to shape those cultural and
  social limits according to an ecology of the spirit; but for what concerns
  us here, the ethical business and entrepreneurial project would be to
  explore new inner dynamics of marketing, new directions in the field of
  possibilities offered by the current organology and its articulations
  between techniques and social organization in order to influence and shape
  marketing as an associative force – in opposition to its current
  dissociative force – in the larger psychic, social and technic organology.
  If the motivation of such a project could be to find new ways of
  efficiency in contrast with the old ways that are hold captive of a
  resource shortening trend, characterizing it of “ethical” underline the
  fact that there is more than a technicist approach of the discipline:
  aiming ethic is a way to care of the impact on the larger public matter,
  the&nbsp;<em>res publica</em>,
  which is equivalent to say that it is a political project in the noble
  understanding of the term. But the converse proposition is also true: not
  caring is a political project. The neoliberal revolution led by Thatcher
  and Reagan following the recommendation of Friedman produced a political
  project implemented through the modern management and the modern marketing
  as an arbitration between short-term efficiency and care, always giving
  right to the first. Thinking an ethical marketing would in that regard
  mean rebalance the arbitration between efficiency and care, while looking
  for ways to compose those ambitions in a new marketing paradigm tending
  toward being panacean, a global thinking of the problem. Such a utopic
  target is largely doomed to fail, but the process of exploring new ways
  could in itself open win-win or just better organization possibilities. It
  is a new attempt to underline that responsibility is the state of being
  conscious of its impact and acting accordingly: forming technicist
  practitioner, that is overfocused overspecialized practitioners missing
  the big picture as well as the long-circuit of thinking of their practice
  is constitutive of a proletarization trend, building a society of
  irresponsibility. This is the dead-end, the limit of our system we are
  experiencing at the moment under the names of democratic, societal,
  economic, ecologic crises.</p>

<h4 id="3-2-1">3.2.1<span class="titletab"></span> Fighting
  the attention and desire resource shortage: stoping to use advertisement?</h4>

<p>In
  the same way that a moderate pollution is hardly eligible to the
  qualification of “ethical”, it is hard to imagine a moderate use of
  psychopower that could be qualified of ethical. Nevertheless, the absence
  of psychological influence is the equivalent to an absence of human
  communication in a transductive understanding of individuation. The
  question is rather here to think the moderation of the psychopower through
  its fractioning and its articulation to the emergent set of value (cf>&nbsp;<em>infra</em>). An ecology
  of the spirit would imply to empower transindividuation, i.e. to make sure
  that an economic activity creates more possibilities of individuation than
  it tend to destroy by attempting to capture attention and canalize
  motivation in a funnel. Empower transindividuation would imply to
  empowering actors of their own lifestyle, winning back the savoir-vivre
  prescribing production, role that marketing through the socialization of
  growingly efficient technologies used to play. In this view, marketing
  became too dominant in its role of social innovation development.</p>

<p>Should
  marketing stop using psychopower? Or is it in the nature of the market
  aimed that marketing has to evolve? That is to say, would it be more
  ethical to push a change in consumerism using the same techniques that
  empowered consumerism at first? It might be here insightful to come back
  to Camenisch’s attempt to sketch marketing ethics guidelines:</p>

<p>“[The]<em>goal of informing the
    potential customer can be brought one step closer to specifically moral
    considerations by drawing on philosopher Richard DeGeorge and others who
    have suggested that transactions are more likely to be morally
    defensible if both parties enter it freely and fully informed. Assuming
    that marketing and marketers want to be part of morally defensible
    transactions, one might then say that viewed societally, the goal of
    marketing should be to increase the likelihood and frequency of free and
    informed transactions in the marketplace. Or, to put it negatively,
    marketing ought not to decrease the likelihood of such free and informed
    market transactions.”&nbsp;</em>(Camenisch
    1991, p.246)</p>

<p>The
  problem of putting freedom as a criteria of morality is that the very
  concept of freedom is a complex issue in a system of transductive
  relationships. Nevertheless, in the same way that the disciplinary
  biopower is a clear infringement on freedom, the industrial use of pycho-
  and neuropower tend to fall under the category of barriers to freedom too.</p>

<p>The
  articulation of neurotechniques – to capture the attention – and
  psychotechniques – to attempt to create motivation – that is advertising
  has a large responsibility in this psycho-social drama that is the
  destruction of&nbsp;<em>savoirs-vivre</em>>&nbsp;and desire. Does it mean that
  advertisement shouldn’t be used?</p>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>People
        who buy magazines slanted towards their interests – such as Vogue,
        Bliss, Loaded, Heat or Fortune – rarely complain about the ads
        because the magazines advertise products of interest. Second, ads
        make much of television and radio free, and keep down the costs of
        magazines and newspapers. Most people think commercials are a small
        price to pay for these benefits. Finally, consumers have
        alternatives: they can zip and zap TV commercials or avoid them
        altogether on many cable and satellite channels. Thus to hold
        consumer attention, advertisers are making their ads more
        entertaining and informative.<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Kotler
    et al. 2005, p.179)</p>

<p>This
  naive defense of advertising, denying the schemes of addiction and the
  fact that we are becoming through the objects of attentions that are put
  on our attentional path, progressively making the questioning of this
  system impossible as it becomes the norm of our milieu, ends by junk-food
  lobbyist declaring that</p>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>obesity
    is a problem of personal responsibility, the only tool to manage those
    overweight problems is a weighing scale, you just have to weight
    yourself<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Horel
    &amp; Rossigneux 2012)</p>

<p>If
  the toxicity of overconsumption was just a question of willpower, either
  close to half of the US as no willpower or enjoy being overweighed (Gates
  2012). This kind of declarations is unbearable for anti-advertisement
  activists – “Adbusters” in Canada, “les Déboulonneurs” in France (Dumas et
  al. 2012) – claiming that their right to avoid attention capture by
  advertising isn’t respected, especially in streets (Dumas et al. 2012).
  Such an assertion is even more scandalous after the progress made in
  cognitive sciences proving that</p>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>The
    reward system is more vulnerable for some individuals. People suffering
    of obesity for instance see their reward system being abnormally
    stimulated by images of hypercaloric food. Advertisements exploit this
    vulnerability and reinforce their overconsumption behaviors.<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Dumas
    et al. 2012)</p>

<p>This
  health disaster that is obesity kicked in important researches observing
  the impact of a limitation or ban of TV food advertising on childhood
  obesity, the results are unequivocal:</p>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>if
    food advertising on TV were banned, significant reductions in the
    prevalence of childhood obesity are possible.<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Veerman
    et al. 2009)</p>

<p>The
  article written by a group of cognitive and social sciences&nbsp;<em>La
    publicité peut avoir des effets nocifs sur la société</em>&nbsp;[Advertisement
  can have harmful effect on society] in an opinion page of the newspaper>&nbsp;<em>Le Monde</em>&nbsp;(26<sup>th</sup>>&nbsp;June 2012) is very insightful
  in that matter:</p>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>What
    is at stake falls to be much more complex than the sole Freedom of
    Speech invoked for the advertiser. But this liberty doesn’t come without
    another liberty, complementary to the first: the liberty of
    non-reception. It would mean to guaranty every citizen the right to
    choose where and when he wants to access the advertising information.
    This would allow him to protect himself from its influence or simply to
    rest from the informational overload<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Dumas
    et al. 2012)</p>

<p>Such
  a restrictive approach of advertisement has already been implemented since
  2006 in Sao Paulo under the name of “Clean City” law, with very
  satisfactory results as even the advertiser, after having fear a major
  crisis of their business, fall to find this ban of outdoor advertisement
  positive (Burgoyne 2007; Vincent Bevins 2010). It naturally went with
  ruses to meet the challenge of the transformation, but the more and more
  controverted billboards, cognitively polluting and inefficient did
  disappear.</p>

<h4 id="3-2-2">3.2.2<span class="titletab"></span> Change
  in the industrial and commercial paradigm</h4>

<h5 id="3-2-2-1">3.2.2.1<span class="titletab"></span> Economy
  of contribution and peer production</h5>

<p>Stiegler
  promote an economy of contribution as a remedy to this loss of&nbsp;<em>savoirs</em>.
  An economy of contribution means that users of a service are contributing
  to the production of these services. The classic example of such a
  contributive production is open-source software that are contributively
  build by potentially hundreds of developers organized in communities. Such
  a decentralize organization of production is growingly extended to new
  domains such as the industrial design of products through communities of
  peers (Bauwens et al. 2012). Such a collaborative activity tend to extend
  the trend inaugurated through the development of Internet networks that
  tend to minimize the gap between the producer and consumer – from the
  original way the Internet is though as a mesh of equal peers to the
  production of web contents by bloggers, both producer and consumer of the
  information – and, in the same movement, blur the frontier between
  professionals and amateurs (Stiegler 2010b).</p>

<h5 id="3-2-2-2">3.2.2.2<span class="titletab"></span> The
  Copernican revolution of the Vendor Relationship Management paradigm</h5>

<p>Coming
  from this culture in which emerged this production paradigm shift, Doc
  Searls push another shift that is the change in the commercial paradigm,
  described as an&nbsp;<em>Intention
    Economy</em>&nbsp;i.e. the
  opposite of the&nbsp;<em>Attention
    Economy</em>&nbsp;(Searls
  2006; Searls 2012): in this Copernican revolution of the commercial
  paradigm, consumers are charged to express and discuss their intention
  (Bauwens et al. 2012) with businesses rather than the usual paradigm in
  which businesses where fighting for a piece of canalized motivation. Here
  the motivation comes to the business already constituted, producing
  tremendous savings in terms of advertisement and customer relationship
  management. Implementing such a system would nevertheless imply that
  marketing departments dispose of a system in which they could value their
  supplies and where they could be easily found by customers. Doc Searls
  promotes his answer to this issue: the Vendor Relationship Management
  system.</p>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>VRM
    development work is based on the belief that free customers are more
    valuable than captive ones — to themselves, to vendors, and to the
    larger economy. To be free —</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Customers must enter relationships with vendors as independent
        actors.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Customers must be the points of integration for their own data.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Customers must have control of data they generate and gather.
        This means they must be able to share data selectively and
        voluntarily.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Customers must be able to assert their own terms of engagement.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Customers must be free to express their demands and intentions
        outside of any one company's control.<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Project
        VRM 2012)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This
  is a profoundly game-changing approach regarding the previous developments
  of commercial relationships and their last declination under the name of –
  commercially used –&nbsp;<em>big
    data</em>&nbsp;that is the
  rush for consumers’ information potentially leading to the same dead-end
  of attention destruction and affective saturation than the former offline
  paradigm. A VRM system working as a marketplace, ranking the different
  offers, would attempt to canalize marketing’s energy and ruses in a single
  place, in which the criteria of Camenisch formulating that “the goal of
  marketing should be to increase the likelihood and frequency of free and
  informed transactions in the marketplace” would be a central pillar that
  doesn’t come without remembering the ideal of a pure and perfect market
  pictured by Classical economists regarding the two points of a less
  imperfect and less biased information in a cultural context overvaluing
  transparency, and a bigger atomicity due to the hereafter introduced trend
  for re-localized peer production.</p>

<p>This
  innovative paradigm attempting to reframe the practice of attention
  capture by marketing could elegantly by prolonged by two hypothetical
  add-ons.</p>

<h5 id="3-2-2-3">3.2.2.3<span class="titletab"></span> VRM
  and externalization of the socialization process</h5>

<p>Promoting
  the end of advertisement, defined as an unsolicited attempt to capture
  attention means to find a new way to make the information circulate, what
  was the primary goal of advertisement. Until there is no alternative to
  massive advertisement campaign for the information circulation, it is
  indeed hard to ask entrepreneurs and managers to get rid of those
  successors of propaganda: such a transition process necessarily imply
  adaptation costs from the producer and the consumer side, and possible
  competitive disadvantage against competitors still maximizing profit
  through advertisement means. But the internet transformation of the
  general organology offers new way to think information circuits and
  potentially constitute an opportunity to externalize the socialization
  process of products that is to empower citizen-consumers organized in
  communities of professional-amateur as practitioners and prescribers of
  lifestyles, playing the role of pioneers in their favorite(s) field(s) of
  expertise, their own field of savoir development, and thus, as amateurs,
  individuating themselves through the stabilization of new savoirs.
  Empowering groups of citizen doesn’t annihilate the risks of mis-use or
  counterproductive interest-taker behaviors but a well-designed system of
  trust between peers could minimize this risk by creating a dependency to
  what social capital other peers give you, as it is happening in the
  sharing economy: the credibility of a contributive peer would be
  guaranteed through what the P2P Foundation calls&nbsp;<em>Feedback
    systems and peer-police&nbsp;</em>(P2P
  Foundation 2012).</p>

<p>This
  production of recommendations toward a field of possibilities, regardless
  of the merchant or non-merchant aspect of those possibilities would find a
  powerful ally in a strong structuration of products characteristics,
  allowing customers to personalize their choices according to their desire
  and constraints: such a “VRM+” system would allow a customer allergic to
  gluten to block every product on the platform containing gluten or trace
  of gluten, or to weight the importance of environmental aspects in his
  choices – as it tend already to be developed in systems such as HopCube in
  France and other comparable initiatives around Europe and the US –, which
  might result in a ranking of the different relevant supplies. Marketing
  would then be the art of being as high as possible in this ranking, as it
  is happening in SEO for search engines, but in this context of criteria
  explosion, marketing would then be the disciple of listening to customers’
  wishes and aspiration needing an attention, in order to kick in the
  production or to adapt the following series.</p>

<h5 id="3-2-2-4">3.2.2.4<span class="titletab"></span> Toward
  a possible equi-power</h5>

<p>Such
  a system would tremendously re-configure the balance of power and tend
  toward a form of equi-power i.e. a social organization in which abuses of
  a “big” would be the potential object of a ranking sanction by the peers.
  Indeed, as intuited in the first part with the movie&nbsp;<em>The
    Corporations</em>, the&nbsp;<em>global
    village</em>&nbsp;miss the
  sanction power against those who play against village inhabitants that was
  the banishment sanction: former communal societies maintain a form of care
  and attention system between inhabitants as it was too expensive, too
  risky for ones to play against the community one’s was directly dependent
  of, in a system of tight solidarity ties. The care and attention would
  comeback once this self-regulative function will be made easy and obvious,
  a form of artificial self-censuring Super-Ego that corporations, while
  pretending to be individual, are desperately missing. Thereafter, contrary
  to biological Darwinism, a form of economic Darwinism would let to
  conscious organization the right to curve their path toward a durable
  configuration in accordance with the social ecosystem. This could be
  understood as the lowering of fences in the metastable social milieu, in
  which corporation use to benefit of a great influence in the
  transformation of the milieu without letting the milieu, their
  interlocutors in the commercial communication i.e. their consumers,
  transform them in return: the idea of equi-power is a form of
  homogenization of the social matter, in which the distortions in the
  balance of power would be compensated by the gathering of small forces
  sharing a common interest. Such a sanction systems, if successfully
  implemented, would make value-destructing businesses progressively decline
  and hopefully bankrupt, by a mechanism analog to the social capital but
  extended to unrestricted fields of evaluation criteria, making the only
  long-term valuable strategic choice being attentive, caring of it
  interlocutors and other stakeholders, in order to maintain a long term
  satisfyingly high ranking. It would be utopic to think that the “being
  cool” marketing, that is a trend to conglomerate around objects of
  attention transmitting a particularly efficient signal in the symbolic
  milieu at a given time, would disappear, but marketers would have to make
  those two objectives compose together.</p>

<p>The
  efficiency of this artificial global Super-Ego would rely on the
  sophistication of the information structure: after a certain level of
  sophistication in the weighting of the ranking and its filters mechanisms,
  customers would be also able to make much more elaborate rules of
  behavior: it might be possible to register to an add-on set of parameters
  ruling the ranking, by could be declared a strong animosity for a given
  peer of the platform – let’s call him Monsanto or Goldman Sachs – and not
  only to block its integration to the ranking competition but also to
  inform its partners in business that due to the following accusations of
  non-attentiveness toward given subject of concern, they will also be
  penalized – if not also blocked – until their partner stops its harmful
  activities or until they stop to do business together. This social capital
  contagion is nevertheless a tool that would need to be controlled in its
  form of violence by extensive testings and iterations with forms of
  protections for the smallest peers, that is to say to keep this form of
  social violence to institutionalized, classic forms of businesses, clearly
  beyond the line of what should be acceptable in the global village.</p>

<p>This
  intellectual pirouette of making marketing becomes the discipline aiming
  the careful integration of industrial production in the society worth a
  try regarding marketing’s current impact: the goal is here to create an
  artificial form of majority that is a self-censuring responsible behavior
  of corporations.</p>

<h4 id="3-2-3">3.2.3<span class="titletab"></span> Opportunities
  of the new social organization and P2P-RM</h4>

<p>The
  idea to build an immaterial marketplace aiming to tend toward pure
  information as a mean to sustain a demerchandized symbolic milieu,
  implying a public sphere freed from the marketing ubiquity, might
  nevertheless raise the risk of losing the heat of a human contact that
  imply meeting around a commercial exchange, trend that already started
  with the skyrocketing of e-commerce, and that constitute for already
  isolated people a risk of greater solitude. Out of the fact that the
  merchant relationships don’t substitute to a tie social integration, an
  answer regarding the emerging context would be that the trend of peer
  production is also a trend of re-localization, and that the culture
  promoting this shift carries a bigger valuation of the social
  interactions. The chance of such a project is that both the social and
  technique aspects of the organology needed are in their early
  individuation process. For the social aspect, the late 1990s and the 2000s
  have seen the emergence of the&nbsp;<em>cultural
    creatives</em>&nbsp;counterculture,
  corresponding to what Rifkin describes as the “empathic civilization”
  (Rifkin 2010). This growing counterculture with a high valuation of a
  global consciousness that is of responsibility, clearly in rupture with
  the dominant consumerist-minded society:</p>

<p class="quote"><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><em>Over
    the past decade, researchers have revealed that about a quarter of
    Americans and Europeans are ‘cultural creatives’, who have made a
    comprehensive shift in their worldview, values and way of life. They are
    disenchanted with materialism, greed, status displays and glaring social
    inequalities. Instead, they are placing emphasis in their lives on
    relationships, communities, spirituality, nature and the environment,
    and real ecological sustainability.<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></em> – &nbsp;(Eckersley
    2009)</p>

<p>This
  valuation of social interactions is the variably conscious result of the
  bigger importance of social capital, which calculative-concern could be
  completed by a cultural aspiration to care more, in a way tending toward
  disinterest, in association with the forces of the emerging
  counterculture. This supposedly culturally borne disinterest has actually
  a rational justification: the flight from the mono-value culture only
  valuating the pecuniary accountancy proven to be limited in its capacity
  to produce forms of happiness and the converse motto that looking for
  oneself psychological well-being maximization is a perfectly rational
  behavior, even if often contradictory to the&nbsp;<em>homo
    oeconomicus</em>&nbsp;(van
  den Broek 2012). This emerging culture also brings complementary
  reflections regarding the attempt to re-thinks the places of sociability,
  illustrated by the development of coworking spaces as a&nbsp;<em>third-place</em>>&nbsp;– multi-use spaces, mixing
  socially and generationally heterogeneous populations –, which development
  is transformed by the raise of an interest for contribution economy, peer
  production and sharing economy co-individuating trends and transforming
  those trends, giving for instance the&nbsp;<em>fablabs</em>>&nbsp;i.e. places of open
  innovation, open design, collaborative production that are a composition
  of those trends. This emerging culture, currently accelerating the
  phenomenon of the sharing economy between peers – including the
  collaborative consumption trend – empowered numerous projects dealing with
  the management of peer resources (Léonard &amp; OuiShare 2011), with the
  idea that the property is less useful – if not a burden – than the useful
  effects we attend of a given good. This trend as the potential to compose
  with VRM to form what could be called a P2P-RM system, a Peer-to-Peer
  Resources/Relationships Management system: the fence between producer and
  consumer is here accentuated in its porosity in a way that peers offers
  come as alternatives to the ones of larger businesses, highlighting that
  the fence between professional and amateur has to keep blurring in a
  context of open knowledge in order to empower the development of
  individual and collective know-hows. It also highlights the possibility of
  an arbitration between the greater flexibility and bigger social value of
  local peers’ offers and the offers of larger businesses benefiting from
  economies of scale and a potentially more sophisticated articulation of>&nbsp;<em>useful effects</em>>&nbsp;[the translation of Philippe
  Moati’s expression “les effets utiles”].</p>

<p>This
  social milieu potentially favorable to such a shift in marketing practices
  is completed by another aspect of the social milieu that is, after 2011,
  the global indignation phenomenon in a context of systemic crises, which
  took several names from&nbsp;<em>Indignados</em>>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Occupy
    Wall Street, London, La Defense</em>&nbsp;or>&nbsp;<em>Frankfurt</em>, the
  popular support for various forms of action from&nbsp;<em>Wikileaks</em>,>&nbsp;<em>Anonymous</em>’s DDoS
  attacks or even the more consensual&nbsp; Avaaz.org &nbsp;petition
  campaigns. One’s frustrated by the apparent inefficiency of DDoS attacks
  or Avaaz campaigns that are an attempt of non-legal sanctioning of global
  corporations on the basis of an often justified concern and anger, would
  find in a peer-generated permanent reminder of the necessity of acting
  responsibly to immoderate corporations, an elegant attempt to reshape the
  globally unbalanced system.</p>

<p>Such
  a project carries at least two main advantages: first, it offers marketers
  a new way to think their relationships with customers with a new role as
  responsive “empowerer” of a desire, resulting in a motivation to buy
  externally produced and thus freed from the inefficient advertisement
  costs. This role of&nbsp;<em>capabilities</em>>&nbsp;shaper –&nbsp;<em>capabilities</em>>&nbsp;understood as the term of
  Amartya Sen for the empowering possibilities that offers an economy (Sen
  2000) – in collaboration with the communities of professional-amateur
  peers, in a horizontal and as permeable relation as possible, is what
  seems to be the best way to bring industrially produced means at the heart
  of learning communities, that is transindividuating communities. This
  paradigm of a permeability of means between the undertaking and the
  community in total openness of the final product, developing a common
  value is the major contribution of opensource software to the business
  thinking, illustrated by the implication of societies such as IBM or Red
  Hat in the development of the opensource operating system Linux (Kambil et
  al. 1999, p.40). Secondly, it offers the opportunity to avoid the
  catastrophe that is the frontal experience of the system limits regarding
  the global balance of power, the giant inequality of power between
  corporation and the average citizen growingly felt as an unbearable fact
  of the previous system, a catastrophe potentially resulting in a massive
  destruction of wealth. Under the control of communities valuating the
  commons and the social peace, following the example of the Wikimedia
  Foundation, and thus playing the role of the indispensable moderators,
  such a system would however produce a social violence that would ideally
  be the intelligent expression of a concern, from which any excess wouldn’t
  be worse than the other form of expression let to the average citizen
  against corporation and by transfer against society at large that is the
  physical violence.</p>

<p>The
  technical milieu is also ready for such an inversion of the commercial
  paradigm as proved by researches in the development of technologies
  solving heterogenous but convergent problems regarding giant data base,
  decentralized storage of data connected through API in a form of VRM,
  semantic web, IndieWeb and other to come. Those developments won’t be
  detailed here but constitute what looks like a preindividual milieu to a
  socio-technic organ to come, aiming to transform the larger organology by
  the use of a general pharmacology that is an deeper understanding of
  techniques impact and there socialization through business processes. Such
  a socio-technic organ would constitute a new challenge for marketing and
  an opportunity to re-build the resource that corporate at large lack maybe
  the most after responsibility toward the common goods: trust.</p>
