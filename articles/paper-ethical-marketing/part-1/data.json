  "description": "In terms of institution organization at large, the marketing is thus the function in an institution that&nbsp;organizes the relation between an activity and the rest of society in order to satisfy a pre-defined objective, through potentially all available means. It is thus not only limited to “satisfying customer needs” but also gather the means by which any organization – businesses, social businesses and non-profit businesses, associations, non-governmental organizations or even governmental organizations – can manage its relationships with the rest of the society.
