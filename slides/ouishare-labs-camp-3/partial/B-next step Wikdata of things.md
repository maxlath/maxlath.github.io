- wikidata limit: can't cover everything (cf discussion with OpenStreetMap)


-replace Google Books
-reboot openproductdata
-the missing piece for economic open knowledge between Wikidata and Open Street Map

problem of a wikidata for things: hard to get a good quality on so many items but associated to an Inventaire, we could get more eyes on the data and thus driving more contributors => opportunity to boost contributions and thus quality

the next step is associate free and contribute knowledge improvement to our daily tools
